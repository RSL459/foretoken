# Router Maintenance

English | [中文](MAINTAINER_zh.md)

Router algorithms are compiled into the Frontend binary. They are not runtime plugins and are not a public extension surface.

## Pipeline contracts

Each request is processed as:

```text
compatible and healthy candidates
→ Filter indexes
→ Scorer scores parallel to retained candidates
→ Picker index
→ RouteDecision
```

- `RouteFilter` returns indexes of candidates to retain.
- `RouteScorer` returns one `RouteScore` for every retained candidate in the same order.
- `RoutePicker` returns an index into the scored candidates.

The Router owns candidate identity and validates duplicate or out-of-range indexes and score-count mismatches. Algorithms must not maintain a second route catalog or query model servers on the request path; they receive an immutable round-local observation snapshot.

## Adding an algorithm

Implement the appropriate interface under `src/algorithm/filter/`, `src/algorithm/scorer/`, or `src/algorithm/picker/`. Add one entry to the corresponding stage's `declare_router_algorithms!` list in `mod.rs`, providing the module name, type name, and user-facing configuration name. The macro generates the module declaration, public re-export, and compiled descriptor registration; no Controller enum or CRD change is required. Update maintained examples, the user-facing Router README, and contract tests only when observable behavior changes.

Request-local shared state belongs in `RouterPipeline::with_customized_context`. The Router creates one context per request and drops it when that request finishes.

## Multi-stage routing

Algorithms score the complete compatible and healthy candidate snapshot. Before picking, the Router narrows it to the current execution stage and its selected controller-defined pipeline scope. This preserves aggregate, P/D, and E/P/D execution ownership while allowing a scorer to account for related stage load.

## `prefix`

Score is `weight * min(1, matched_blocks * block_size / scale)^2 + (1 - weight) * matched_blocks / total_blocks`.
Missing observations and zero complete request blocks score zero. Block size comes from the
exact source partition, including confirmed misses. Cache salts, LoRA, unsupported multimodal
inputs, and explicit cache opt-out do not receive cache credit.

`RouteScore.preference` preserves floating-point scores without quantization. Foretoken owns
input production, endpoint eligibility, and tie breaking. `scorerParameters` passes through
the CRD and controller environment to the selected scorer at frontend startup.
